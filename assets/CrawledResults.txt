Research teams at HKUST have been working tirelessly to contribute to the global taskforce for coronavirus control, from speeding up the detection of virus carriers, halting the spread of the virus to developing a vaccine. Watch the video! Learn More How University Inventions are Fighting COVID-19, from Virus-slaying Air Purifiers to Delivery Robots HKUST President Prof. Wei SHYY has recently shared how university inventions are fighting COVID-19, from virus-slaying air purifiers to delivery robots, on World Economic Forum 'Agenda'. Learn More Autonomous Vehicles Developed by HKUST Engineering Professor Serve the Community during COVID-19 Outbreak in Mainland China Autonomous vehicles move around on public roads to help transport food, spray disinfectant and broadcast messages. Professor LIU Ming shares his journey from inventing Hong Kong’s first autonomous car at HKUST in 2017 to serving the community during COVID-19 outbreak. Learn More HKUST Researchers Develop a Smart Fever Screening System Offering a More Efficient Solution to Safeguard Public Health A multidisciplinary research team led by Prof. Richard SO of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics has devised a new system which could help officials at the border points to easily identify and distinguish passengers with fever. Learn More HKUST Develops New Smart Antimicrobial Coating in Fight Against COVID-19 Developed by a team led by Prof. YEUNG King-Lun, Professor of the Department of Chemical & Biological Engineering and the Division of Environment & Sustainability, the new MAP-1 coating is highly versatile with an effective period of up to 90 days. MAP-1 coating provides lasting protection and surface disinfection against microbial contamination. Learn More HKUST Scientists Shed Light on COVID-19 Vaccine Development “Among the SARS epitopes that can trigger an immune action, we found a small fraction which exists in both SARS and COVID-19, with their genetic sequences being exactly the same. We believe these are the most likely candidates which can trigger an immune response against COVID-19,” said Prof. Matthew MCKAY. Learn More HKUST Researchers Develop Smart Geo-Fencing Technology for Home Quarantine amid COVID-19 Pandemic A team of researchers and engineers led by Prof. Gary CHAN, Professor of Department of Computer Science and Engineering, has innovated and designed an automated geo-fencing technology called “Signature Home”.

COMP is our general undergraduate degree program. It provides a broad education in all core areas of Computer Science, while allowing students the flexibility to pursue individual interests in higher-level areas. COSC is a special program catered only to students wishing to double-major with other degrees. Thus, it offers more flexibility in fulfilling the requirements. Additionally, we offer interdisciplinary joint programs with other departments. For details on all of these programs, please refer to the links below. BEng in Computer Science (COMP) BSc in Computer Science (COSC) BEng in Computer Engineering (CPEG) BSc in Data Science and Technology (DSCT) BSc in Risk Management and Business Intelligence (RMBI) Dual Degree Program in Technology and Management BEng in Computer Science and BBA in General Business Management (COGBM) BEng in Computer Engineering and BBA in General Business Management (CPGBM) Additional Major(s) Minor Programs Students of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering can enrol in various minor programs. Typically, each minor program requires students to complete 18 credits from a list of courses. To graduate with a minor program, students must declare their intention and complete Form RR-37 (Declaration / Withdrawal of Undergraduate Minor Program) to enroll in the minor program. For registration procedure and schedule, please refer to ARRO's Minor Programs web site (ITSC login required) and pay attention to the department's deadlines. All courses that count toward the minor program will be included in the calculation of the GGA. Minor Program in Big Data Technology (for non-IT Minor students) - application deadline (with effective term in Spring 2019-20): on or before 5pm of 26 February 2020 (Wednesday).

Covering topics in the areas of foundations of computer science and computer engineering, artificial intelligence, networking, computer graphics, multimedia computing, software and web technologies, and data and knowledge-base systems, the Computer Science programs at this University are dedicated to educate students and to advance research in computer and information technology; as well as to assist in the development and growth of the information industry in the region. Through the efforts of researchers and engineers, computers have evolved from large, slow, expensive, and very specialized systems to small, fast, affordable, and ordinary tools that are part of virtually everyone's life. Advances in networking technologies and human-computer interfacing technologies have further created a digital culture. The ubiquitous nature of computers in today's workplace and home environment is making computer literacy a requirement not only for all professionals in industrial societies but also for everybody living in the digital culture. Computer Science is still a young field. Although we have witnessed numerous advances in the past, this is only the beginning of a new revolution as the potential of information technology has not yet been fully realized. Information technology is in the midst of a revolution as we move from explicit interactions with disconnected computing devices to implicit and pervasive interactions with highly interconnected, integrated digital resources embedded in the environments in which we work, live, learn, and play. The impact of computer science and information engineering will be broad and deep. Computer Science programs at HKUST prepare students for exciting challenges and new opportunities that help to bring such impact to our lives. The Department offers a full range of courses to meet the needs of its own students and those from other departments. Its programs lead to the BEng, BSc, MSc, MPhil, and PhD degrees. Aside from taking computer science courses, students are encouraged to design individual study plans tailored to their own interests.
